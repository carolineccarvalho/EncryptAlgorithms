## Prefix-Preserving Encryption

This project implements a **prefix-preserving algorithm** based on the Feistel Cipher, ensuring that the structure of the input data is retained while anonymizing it effectively.

The design is inspired by the article *"A Feistel Network-based Prefix-Preserving Anonymization Approach Applied to Network Traces"*, published by IEEE.
